We see that strategy $x_{2}$ is strongly dominated by the pure strategy strategy $y_{2}$. Here we look at the columns, hence we are looking at player 2, hence we have to consider the payoffs of player 2. The strong domination is clear, since $3 < 6$ and $2 < 7$. The table becomes

\begin{tabular}[h!]{l|ccccc}
		&& $y_2$ \\
		\hline
		$x_1$ && 6,6 & \\
		$y_1$ && 3,7 &
	\end{tabular}

We see that strategy $y_{1}$ is strongly dominated by the pure strategy strategy $x_{1}$. Here we look at the rows, hence we are looking at player 1, hence we have to consider the payoffs of player 1. The strong domination is clear, since $3 < 6$. The table becomes

\begin{tabular}[h!]{l|ccccc}
		&& $y_2$ \\
		\hline
		$x_1$ && 6,6 &
\end{tabular}

Hence the only equilibrium of this game is $\parent{x_1, y_2}$, and the associated payoff is $w = \parent{6,6}$.
