\paragraph{1.} No. For both players (the game is symmetric), strategy \textit{Cooperate} is strongly dominated by strategy \textit{Defect}. Indeed, if the other player plays \textit{Cooperate}, then I can either win 6 by playing \textit{Cooperate} or 7 by playing \textit{Defect}. If the other player plays \textit{Defect}, I can either win 1 by playing \textit{Cooperate} or 2 by playing \textit{Defect}. Therefore, I will always win more by playing \textit{Defect} and so it is the optimal strategy.

\paragraph{2.} We can improve our payoff if we communicate with the other player. Indeed, for example, you could say to the other player :
\emph{Whatever you do, I will play "Defect" but if you play "Cooperate" I will give you 3.}
