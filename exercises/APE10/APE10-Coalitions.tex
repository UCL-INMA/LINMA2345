\section{} Alice, Bob and Carol wish to connect to the Internet. The cost of such a connection depends on the total length of cables that it requires. Of course, the players also need to be connected to the provider $\Omega$. The costs of the possible connections are given by the following graph.
\begin{figure}[!ht]

Therefore, connecting all the players has a total cost of 26, an amount that they then need to share. Furthermore, for each player, being connected to the Internet represents a profit of 20.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[a.] If the players can agree on a division of connection fees, what solution do you propose?
%	what is the \emph{core} in which they will choose their individual costs?
	\item[b.] Suppose you were the provider, and that you wanted to impose costs that are as honest as possible. How would you divide the costs?
\end{enumerate}

\section{} An owner wishes to hire staff to grow potatoes in his field. If $k$ people work the land (including the owner), they produce potatoes for a value of $f(k)$. Suppose that the function $f$ is increasing, that $f(0) = 0$ and that the contribution of an additional person strictly decreases (that is to say, $f(k) - f(k-1)$ is strictly decreasing). The aim is for stakeholders to negotiate their wages. Let $n$ be the number of people working the land, and $x_i$ be worker $i$'s salary, with $x_1$ being the salary of the owner. We know that $x_1 + \dots + x_n \leq f(n)$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[a.] Can a worker claim a wage $x_i > f(n) - f(n-1)$? What would happen then? (Hint: describe the core of the game).
	\item[b.] Now suppose that all workers agree that none of them should engage unless it is as a group. What happens to the core in this case?
	\item[d.] Suppose now that $f(k) - f(k-1)$ is strictly increasing. Show that the core of this game contains the uniform vector of wages, that is, where each player receives an equal share of the produced wealth. (Hint: Since $f(k) - f(k-1)$ is increasing, we can show that  $\frac{f(k)}{k} < \frac{f(k + 1)}{k + 1} $ for all $k$, and $f(n)/n \leq (f(n) - f(k))/(n-k)$. )
\end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{The notion of core}
	\vspace{.3cm}

	Let $N$ be the grand coalition of all players and $v$ be the characteristic function that associates a value $v (S)$ to any coalition $S \subseteq N$. An allocation of payoffs $x$ is the \emph{core} of $v$ iff
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{i \in N}{x_i} = v(N) \text{ et } \sum_{i\in S}{x_i} \geq v(S), \quad \forall S \subseteq N
	\end{align*} 
	where the second condition requires that no coalition can improve the payoffs of its participants.

	\vspace{.3cm}
	\item \textbf{The Shapley value}
	\vspace{.3cm}
	
	The Shapley value if the only function $\phi$ that satisfies the following behavioral axioms:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Symmetry}: If one permutes the order of the players and that Player $i$ becomes Player $j$, then the Shapley value for Player $i$ in the original game has to be equal to that of Player $j$ in the new game.
		\item \textbf{Support}: If a player has nothing to bring to the coalition, he earns nothing.
		\item \textbf{Linearity}: For all characteristic function $v$ and $w$, for all $0 \leq p \leq 1$ and for all player $i$: $\phi_i(pv + (1-p)w) = p\phi_i(v) + (1-p)\phi_i(w)$.
	\end{enumerate}
	These a priori reasonable axioms lead to a unique solution, including situations in which the core is empty. The Shapley values can be explicitly computed by:
	\begin{align*}
		\phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N -i}{\dfrac{|S|!(|N| - |S| - 1)!}{|N|!} (v(S \cup {i}) - v(S))}.
	\end{align*}
	
\end{itemize}
