One should show that there exist any utility function satisfying the axioms of the lotteries [0], [400] and [600].   Let denote their expected gain respectively $v_0,v_{400}$ and $v_{600}$. From the inequalities of the exercise, we can deduce the following inequalities : 
\begin{align}
&v_{400} > 0.9v_{600} +0.1 v_0  \\
&0.2v_{600} + 0.8v_0 > 0.25v_{400} +0.75v_0 \\
&v_{600} > v_0 
\end{align}
The inequality (2) can be rewritten as : 
$$v_{400} < 0.8v_{600} +0.2v_0$$ 
When combining it with inequality (1) we have that : 
\begin{align*}
    0.9v_{600} +0.1 v_0 &< v_{400} < 0.8v_{600} +0.2v_0\\
     &\Downarrow \\
     v_{600}&<v_0
\end{align*}

Which contradicts the inequality (3) . Hence, there exist none utility function satisfying the axioms.
